Dart Decimate is a Rust-native codebase intelligence tool for Dart and Flutter. It
looks at your repo as a graph:

- Dart files are nodes.
- `import`, `export`, `part`, `part of`, and `library augment` are edges.
- The report tells you what is unused, risky, duplicated, tangled, or hard to
  maintain.

It is not a formatter. It is not a replacement for `dart analyze`. It is not a
Flutter style guide. It does not enforce opinions like "all providers must use
Riverpod code generation."

It answers practical questions:

- What code can probably be deleted?
- What files depend on each other in a circle?
- What functions are too complex?
- What code was copied around?
- What dependency is unused or missing from `pubspec.yaml`?
- What changed code is risky before a PR lands?
- What should an AI coding agent inspect before making a fix?

## Start Here

Inside any Dart or Flutter project, run this:

```bash
npx --yes dart-decimate human .
```

That is the easiest command. It checks the whole repo for dead code, circular
dependencies, duplicated code, complex functions, dependency hygiene,
architecture drift, Flutter graph issues, security candidates, and PR-risk
signals.

To open the same report in your browser:

```bash
npx --yes dart-decimate html .
```

To review only files changed from another branch or ref:

```bash
npx --yes dart-decimate html . --compare origin/main
```

`--compare REF` aliases `--changed-since REF`. If the ref is not found,
Dart Decimate suggests similar local or remote branches.

For JSON output that agents and CI can parse:

```bash
npx --yes dart-decimate json .
```

If the human report says `FAIL`, or JSON says `"verdict": "fail"`, Dart Decimate
worked. It means it found error-level issues. It does not mean the tool crashed.

Exit codes:

- `0`: no error-level findings
- `1`: Dart Decimate found issues
- `2`: command, config, or runtime error
- `8`: security gate found new review-required candidates

## Install

You do not need to install anything permanently. Use `npx`:

```bash
npx --yes dart-decimate human .
```

Add this to `package.json` if you want a short project command:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dart-decimate": "dart-decimate json ."
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "dart-decimate": "^0.0.13"
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dart-decimate
```

If you prefer Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/sgaabdu4/dart-decimate
```

Cargo installs `dart-decimate` and `dart-decimate-mcp` into `~/.cargo/bin`.

Fish:

```bash
fish_add_path ~/.cargo/bin
```

Bash or Zsh:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

From a local checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgaabdu4/dart-decimate.git
cd dart-decimate
cargo install --path . --force
```

Then run it in your app:

```bash
cd /path/to/flutter_or_dart_repo
dart-decimate check . --format json
```

## npx

The npm package name is `dart-decimate`. These commands do not require a global
install.

Check everything:

```bash
npx --yes dart-decimate human .
```

Machine-readable JSON:

```bash
npx --yes dart-decimate json .
```

Open the HTML report in your browser:

```bash
npx --yes dart-decimate html .
```

The `html` shortcut opens the report by default. On report commands, use
`--format html` to print static HTML or `--open` to write a private temporary
file and open it in the default browser.

Generated finding reports group issues by type in numbered, collapsible
sections. Search narrows visible findings, and type filters open the selected
group.

Human terminal reports strip control characters from user-derived paths and
messages; HTML reports escape user-derived content.

Print the HTML report instead:

```bash
npx --yes dart-decimate html . --stdout > dart-decimate-report.html
```

Changed files only: `npx --yes dart-decimate html . --compare origin/main`.
`--compare REF` aliases `--changed-since REF` and suggests similar branches when
the ref is not found.

To run the GitHub version directly:

```bash
npx --yes --package github:sgaabdu4/dart-decimate dart-decimate check . --format json
```

## What Dart Decimate Looks For

### 1. Dead Code

Dead code is code that is not reachable from your entry points.

Dart Decimate finds:

- dead Dart files
- unused public exports
- unused type aliases
- unused enum values
- unused private class members
- unrendered Flutter widgets
- missing entry points
- stale `dart-decimate-ignore` comments

Default entry points are evaluated across the root and discovered local package
roots. They include public `lib/` Dart files outside `lib/src/`, `lib/main.dart`,
direct `bin/` scripts, and, outside production mode, direct `test/`,
`integration_test/`, `test_driver/`, `tool/`, `scripts/`, and `pigeon/`
scripts. Generated Dart companions, Flutter l10n outputs, and FlutterFire
options are protected from dead-file cleanup; generated-only cycles are also
suppressed.

Unused-symbol checks count references from non-raw Dart string interpolation;
raw strings and escaped dollars stay literal.

Useful commands:

```bash
dart-decimate dead-code . --entry lib/main.dart --format json
dart-decimate check . --unused-files --unused-exports --unused-deps --format json
```

### 2. Complex Code

Cyclomatic complexity means "how many paths can this function take?"

Cognitive complexity means "how hard is this function to understand?"

CRAP score combines complexity with test coverage. A complex function with poor
coverage gets a worse score.

Dart Decimate finds:

- high cyclomatic complexity
- high cognitive complexity
- high combined complexity
- high CRAP score
- coverage gaps
- low health score files
- hotspots
- refactoring targets

Useful commands:

```bash
dart-decimate health . --format json
dart-decimate health . --complexity-breakdown --top 10 --format json
dart-decimate health . --file-scores --hotspots --targets --format json
```

### 3. Duplicated Code

Duplication means the same Dart code appears in more than one place.

Dart Decimate finds exact and semantic clone groups. Each clone group gets a stable
fingerprint like `dup:abc12345`, so agents can trace it before touching code.
Clone windows must meet both line and token thresholds; sparse duplicated blocks
can span more than `--min-lines`, and `line_count` reports the actual match.
Declaration-only abstract contracts are filtered, and copied local Pub package
mirrors are canonicalized before same-mirror matches are ignored.

Useful commands:

```bash
dart-decimate dupes . --format json
dart-decimate dupes . --mode semantic --min-lines 5 --format json
dart-decimate dupes . --threshold 5 --format json
dart-decimate trace-clone . --fingerprint dup:abc12345 --format json
```

### 4. Circular Dependencies

A circular dependency means file A depends on file B, and B eventually depends
back on A. Cycles make code harder to move, test, and delete.

Dart Decimate finds:

- circular dependencies
- re-export cycles
- import/export/part/augment targets that do not resolve
- invalid `part` / `part of` relationships

Generated typed GoRouter route registry back-edges are warning-level only when
the importing file uses real typed-route navigation helpers. Mixed cycles still
emit error-level residual findings for unrelated edges, registry-to-registry
imports, exports, or non-route registry API usage.

Useful commands:

```bash
dart-decimate cycles . --format json
dart-decimate check . --circular-deps --re-export-cycles --format json
```

### 5. Architecture Drift

Architecture drift means code crosses boundaries it should not cross.

Example: `lib/domain/` depending on `lib/ui/`.

Dart Decimate finds:

- boundary violations
- files outside configured boundary zones
- forbidden direct calls across boundaries
- policy-pack violations for banned imports, exports, and calls

Useful command:

```bash
dart-decimate check . \
  --boundary lib/domain:lib/ui \
  --boundary-coverage \
  --format json
```

### 6. Dependency Hygiene

Dependency hygiene means your imports and `pubspec.yaml` agree.

Dart Decimate finds:

- unused runtime dependencies
- unused dev dependencies
- runtime dependencies used only by tests
- imports missing from `pubspec.yaml`
- unused dependency overrides
- invalid dependency overrides
- imports into another package's private `lib/src`
- duplicate public API exports

Dart Decimate follows Pub package ownership when resolving `package:` imports,
using `.dart_tool/package_config.json` when present while keeping same-package
imports and owner-local path dependencies local. Workspace members and copied
nested packages with the same package name are resolved by owner. Non-Dart
tooling references in Flutter config files, including launcher and splash
config, workflow files, Makefiles, and `tool/` scripts can count as dependency
usage. Known generator-internal imports from generated Dart, such as
`package:slang/generated.dart`, are not reported as unlisted dependencies.

Useful commands:

```bash
dart-decimate trace-dependency . --dependency collection --format json
dart-decimate check . --unused-deps --unlisted-deps --private-src-imports --format json
```

### 7. Flutter-Specific Graph Issues

Dart Decimate does not care which state-management style you use. It uses Flutter
and Dart patterns only to avoid false positives and to find graph problems.

Dart Decimate finds:

- GoRouter route path/name collisions
- private Flutter widget classes
- top-level widget helper functions
- unused widget constructor parameters
- widget classes that are never constructed
- missing `context.mounted` guards after awaited widget work

`unused-widget-param` counts normal field reads, forwarding helpers, and Dart
object patterns that destructure the widget class itself. `unrendered-widget`
counts widgets constructed through builder callbacks, while type-only references
do not count as rendering.

### 8. Security Candidates

These are review prompts, not proof of an exploit.

Dart Decimate finds candidates for:

- hardcoded secrets
- insecure HTTP transport
- TLS validation bypasses
- risky WebView settings
- process execution
- raw SQL
- Firebase client API keys in `FirebaseOptions`
- plain local storage of secret-like material

Firebase client API keys are warning-level by default because FlutterFire
generates client config. To make them fail a gate, set
`"dart-decimate/security-firebase-api-key" = "error"` in `[rules]`. Common
authentication copy such as password reset and password requirement text is
filtered before reporting hardcoded-secret candidates unless it is bound to a
secret-like name or contains a concrete token-like segment.

Useful commands:

```bash
dart-decimate security . --surface --format json
dart-decimate security . --ci --sarif-file dart-decimate-security.sarif
git diff --cached --unified=0 | dart-decimate security . --gate new --diff-stdin --format json
dart-decimate security . --gate newly-reachable --compare origin/main --format json
```

`--gate new` keeps candidates on added lines. `--gate newly-reachable` keeps
reachable candidates affected by changed files. Both accept `--compare REF`,
`--changed-since REF`, `--diff-file PATCH`, or `--diff-stdin`.

### 9. PR Risk

Use this before merging changed code.

Dart Decimate reports:

- risk score
- pass / warn / fail risk level
- findings introduced by the PR
- findings that already existed
- risky changed files

Compile-time environment feature flags are warning-level only when every
occurrence is in a non-`lib/` development, tooling, example, or test path, or in
`lib/main_dev.dart`, `lib/main_debug.dart`, `lib/main_e2e.dart`,
`lib/main_test.dart`, or `lib/main_driver.dart`. Other `lib/` files, including
`lib/dev_flags.dart`, services, and screens, remain error-level. SDK/config flag
calls stay error-level by default.

Useful commands:

```bash
dart-decimate audit . --base origin/main --format json
dart-decimate audit . --base origin/main --gate new-only --format json
```

### 10. Runtime Intelligence

Static analysis says what is connected. Runtime coverage says what actually ran.

Dart Decimate can read LCOV, V8, and Istanbul coverage data.

Useful commands:

```bash
dart-decimate health . --coverage coverage/lcov.info --coverage-gaps --max-crap 30 --format json
dart-decimate coverage analyze . --runtime-coverage coverage-final.json --format json
```

## How To Read The Summary

Example:

```json
{
  "files": 466,
  "edges": 1231,
  "quality_score": 93,
  "cycles": 2,
  "code_duplications": 26,
  "complex_functions": 13,
  "dead_files": 11,
  "findings": 125
}
```

Plain English:

- `files`: Dart files Dart Decimate parsed
- `edges`: imports, exports, parts, and augments it resolved
- `quality_score`: project health from `0` to `100`
- `cycles`: emitted circular dependency findings after policy classification
- `code_duplications`: duplicated code groups
- `complex_functions`: functions over the complexity limits
- `dead_files`: files Dart Decimate thinks are unreachable
- `findings`: total issues in the report

## JSON For Agents

Use JSON when another tool or AI agent will read the result:

```bash
dart-decimate check . --format json
```

Every finding includes:

- `rule_id`
- `kind`
- `severity`
- `path`
- `line`
- `column`
- `safe_to_delete`
- related `files`
- related dependency `edge`, when available
- suggested `actions`

Example shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "dart-decimate.report.v1",
  "kind": "combined",
  "tool": "dart-decimate",
  "command": "check",
  "verdict": "fail",
  "summary": {
    "files": 466,
    "edges": 1231,
    "quality_score": 93,
    "findings": 125
  },
  "findings": [],
  "next_steps": []
}
```

When grouped security findings hide additional occurrences, `next_steps` can
include `review-security-surface`, which reruns
`dart-decimate security . --format json --surface`.

If a JSON command fails before a report can be built, stdout still stays
machine-readable:

```json
{ "error": true, "message": "coverage analyze requires --runtime-coverage PATH", "exit_code": 2 }
```

## Fixes

Preview safe fixes:

```bash
dart-decimate fix . --format json
```

Apply confirmed safe fixes:

```bash
dart-decimate fix . --apply --confirm --format json
```

Safe fixes are intentionally conservative. Dart Decimate can currently apply:

- simple dead-file deletion
- stale suppression removal
- one-line unused Pub dependency removal
- one-line unused top-level Dart declaration removal

Everything else stays review-only.

## Watch Mode

Rerun checks while you work:

```bash
dart-decimate watch . --no-clear
```

Run once and exit, useful for scripts:

```bash
dart-decimate watch . --once --format json
```

## MCP

Start the MCP server:

```bash
dart-decimate-mcp
```

Agents can use it to inspect a project, trace files, trace symbols, inspect
duplicates, review PR risk, read runtime coverage slices, preview fixes, and
ask what is safest to do next.

`fix_apply` is the only mutating MCP tool and requires explicit `yes: true`.

## Config

Dart Decimate reads config from:

1. `.dart-decimaterc`
2. `.dart-decimaterc.json`
3. `.dart-decimaterc.jsonc`
4. `dart-decimate.toml`
5. `.dart-decimate.toml`

Example:

```toml
[cli]
format = "json"
entry = ["lib/main.dart"]
production = true

[health]
max_cyclomatic = 20
max_cognitive = 15
coverage_gaps = true
fileScores = true
hotspots = true
targets = true

[dupes]
mode = "semantic"
min_tokens = 80
threshold = 5

[boundaries]
presets = ["layered"]
rules = ["lib/domain:lib/ui"]

[security]
surface = true
categories = ["hardcoded-secret", "firebase-api-key", "insecure-transport", "tls-bypass"]

[rules]
unused-files = "error"
unused-exports = "warn"
security-candidate = "warn"
"dart-decimate/security-firebase-api-key" = "error"
```

## Full Issue List

Run this for the live list:

```bash
dart-decimate schema --format json | jq .issue_types
```

Current issue types:

See [docs/issue-types.md](docs/issue-types.md). Prefer the schema command when
you need the installed binary's exact list.

## CI

See [docs/ci.md](docs/ci.md) for CI checks, PR gates, hook setup, CI
templates, and review-thread reconciliation.

## Scope

Dart Decimate implements local Fallow-style codebase intelligence for Dart and
Flutter.

Fallow features that are JS-specific or require hosted backends return clear
unsupported JSON instead of pretending to work:

```bash
dart-decimate migrate --dry-run --format json
dart-decimate telemetry status --format json
dart-decimate license status --format json
```

## Development

```bash
git diff --check
npm run lint
npm run version:bump:check -- origin/main
npm run release:check
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npx fallow audit --base origin/main --quiet
cargo test --all-targets
npm run pack:check
npm run test:postinstall:prebuilt
npm run test:npx:prebuilt
npm run test:npx:local
npm run test:npx:mcp:local
```

This repository forbids `unsafe_code`.

## Release Flow

Current version: `0.0.13`.

After the first public release, changes should go through pull requests. Every
PR to `main` must bump both `Cargo.toml` and `package.json` above the base
branch and to an unpublished npm version.

To release a new version:

1. Update both `Cargo.toml` and `package.json` to the same unpublished version.
2. Open a PR.
3. Let CI pass.
4. Merge to `main`.
5. GitHub Actions publishes `dart-decimate` to npm, creates tag `vX.Y.Z`, and
   creates the GitHub release.

Release reruns for the same commit may update GitHub release assets. If the npm
package already exists for that commit, the publish step is skipped; a reused tag
or npm version from another commit fails.

Local hooks block direct pushes to `main`, fetch the configured base ref when
needed, and run the same version, release, lint, Fallow, package, and test gates
as the local no-mistakes configuration.
